# VocabHomework-O-Matic

Playing with Java to invoke PowerShell (didn't need to, but wanted to see how to do it) and call web services to do tedious vocabulary homework. I still had to come up with sentences for the words myself, but this program did most of the drudge work for me.

This program has some hard-coded filepaths, so it will probably not work if you pull it unless you change the paths in source code or have the same file structure as me (possible, but highly unlikely). I am including the vocabList.txt file that this program expects on the desktop and defines words for.

Also, I have the API key saved to a config file and excluded from the project here, so you'll have to get your own.
